Protect your rights by reviewing and blocking AI bots from using your content without compensation.

== Description ==
The leader in content syndication for WordPress publishers now helps protect you from Artificial Intelligence companies using your content without compensation. If you are not blocking the AI companies access, they have no incentive to license your content.
<p>Features include:
    <ul>
        <li>Block the bots of leading AI companies from scraping your content</li>
        <li>See the bots name, IP address and last seek date</li>
        <li>Add/remove bots from the block list</li>
        <li>Opt in to create a common AI bot list and give blocked bots instructions on how to license your content.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>SimpleFeed is the leading content syndication solution for WordPress Publishers. We work with over 500 publishers to syndicate their content to Apple News, MSN, SmartNews, Newsbreak, Opera News, Samsung News, Yahoo and just about anywhere your users consume content. We are working with these publishers, and publishers who use this plugin and want to participate, to license their content to leading AI companies.</p>
<p>SimpleFeed has a non-public plug-in which also enables publishers to be more successful in their syndication efforts. SimpleFeed customers get the complete plug in, best practices for successful syndication, and technical support.</p>
<p>Please note that blocking the wrong bot and/or presenting the wrong Robots.txt can lead to traffic declines. This plug in is free and offered “as is” without warranty or support.</p>
<p>Install now to preserve your rights to potential future compensation from the AI companies.</p>

## Use of 3rd Party Services
The AI Rights Protection by SimpleFeed plugin communicates with an external service hosted at [SimpleFeed](https://www.simplefeed.com/wp-content/simplefeed/wp-simplefeed-bots-protection-admin-rest.php) to perform the following functions:

1. **Storage of Plugin Settings**: The plugin sends and retrieves plugin settings to/from the SimpleFeed service. This ensures that your settings are securely stored and synchronized with the external service.
   
2. **Bot Request Statistics**: The plugin collects and stores statistics about bot requests on your WordPress site. These statistics are sent to SimpleFeed for analysis and reporting purposes.
   
3. **Premium Access Validation**: The plugin checks with the SimpleFeed service to verify if your WordPress user account has premium access to the plugin features.

For more information, please review the [SimpleFeed Privacy Policy](https://www.simplefeed.com/other/privacy-policy/) and [Terms of Use](https://www.simplefeed.com/other/tos/).
